# RPi-NetMonitor

A Raspberry Pi project: Network Monitor

The monitor pings different public servers (i.e. DNS servers). If 4 consecutive pings fail, the monitor reboots the CPE (router/cablemodem). We use a relay for this.

## TODO

* Explain how everything works in the README
* Upload a electrical schematic of the system
